# 🔗Narrow-Links

This project is an attempt to make a URL Shortener Service(Narrow-Links): it creates a short, unique URL that will redirect to the specific website of the user's choice.

It is secure and has the HTTP protocol and data encryption.

As a result, if someone wants to share a link or include a link in their profile, they can. There are times when that link is too long and takes up the entire space as well as a lot of characters, which is a problem when there are only a limited number of characters to type. As a result, our project solves the problem. We shorten those long URLs and provide a copy button to quickly copy the short URL.

It also has a QR Code Generator, which generates a QR code of the link pasted by the user and redirects to the Website link that the user pasted by scanning this URL.

Another recent addition is a simple one-click button for sending the link to whomever you want in the form of an SMS. **Twilio's SMS API** is used for this purpose; simply enter the number and hit send, and the shortened link will be sent via SMS to that number.
